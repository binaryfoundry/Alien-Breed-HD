/*
 * Alien Breed 3D I - PC Port
 * player.h - Player control and state management
 *
 * Translates from: Plr1Control.s, Plr2Control.s, PlayerShoot.s
 *
 * The original code has multiple control methods:
 *   - Mouse (PLR1_mouse_control)
 *   - Mouse+KBD (PLR1_mousekbd_control)
 *   - Keyboard only (PLR1_keyboard_control)
 *   - Joystick (PLR1_JoyStick_control)
 *   - Follow path (PLR1_follow_path) - debug/demo
 *
 * All are stubbed for now, but the structure mirrors the original dispatch.
